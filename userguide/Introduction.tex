\section{MFree}
The Mfree libary is a framework developed in Cfor mesh-free modelling in a research environment. It was developing during my PhD for application to stretch blow moulding a manufacturing technique used to produce polymer bottles. The main features of the code are the ability to simulate non-linear solid mechanics problems using an explicit solver. The use of the MFree library is intended to simplify the use of mesh-free methods within a research context, and further provide a learning resource for meshfree methods. 

To facilitate this goal, this manuscript has been created in order to describe the main features of this code.
